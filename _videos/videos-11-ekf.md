This video shows the equations of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) used to estimate the location of a satellite when only angle and range measurements are available. Please, pause the video if needed.

This problem was used in the Final Exam of the Guidance and Navigation graduate class taught at the University of Michigan in the Fall 2020 term.
