Self-excited systems converge to an oscillatory trajectory under constant inputs. These systems appear in thermoacoustics, biochemistry, and fluid-structure interaction. In this work, the structure of a Discrete-Time, Time-Delayed Lur'e Model is proposed to use for identification of self-excited systems due to their relative simplicity in terms of nonlinear models for identification and their potential to display bifurcations.
