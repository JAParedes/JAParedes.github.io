Projection-based, Discrete time, Exponential Matrix CBF (PDTE-MCBF) applied to Bicopter Lateral Flight for position constraint enforcement and nonconvex obstacle avoidance. This formulation is compared with nonconvex CBF formulations and is shown to perform as well and require less runtime per iteration that nonconvex CBF formulations.
