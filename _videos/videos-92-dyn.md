This video shows the equations of motion for a wheel rolling without slipping within another wheel and the results of a numerical simulation are shown. Please, pause the video if needed.

This problem was used in the Midterm and Final Exams of the Intermediate Dynamics graduate class taught at the University of Michigan in the Fall 2021 term.
