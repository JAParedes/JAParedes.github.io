The time-optimal trajectory planning for a multicopter UAV lateral flight problem is formulated as a nonlinear program, which is subsequently solved to obtain time-optimal state and input trajectories for vertical and horizontal displacement with flip maneuvers. The results are illustrated in the video with figures and animations.

The code and more information about the setup are available in <a href = "https://github.com/JAParedes/Trajectory_Optimization_for_Multicopter_UAV_Lateral_Flight">  https://github.com/JAParedes/Trajectory_Optimization_for_Multicopter_UAV_Lateral_Flight </a>
