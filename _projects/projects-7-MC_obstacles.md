<b>Source of Funding:</b> 2017 Research Project Annual Contest (CAP 2017).

The aim of the project is the development of a device that can be attached to a multicopter running the PX4 flight controller firmware to allow avoidance of obstacles in flight missions.

The main tasks performed in this project were the following:

- Designed and fabricated prototype structure to mount LIDAR sensor and companion computer to multicopter frame.
- Developed multirotor guidance algorithm for concurrent goal seeking and obstacle avoidance using GPS and LIDAR measurements.
- Verified system operation and embedded controller performance through Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations.
