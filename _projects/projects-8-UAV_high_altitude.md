<b>Source of Funding:</b> National Program of Agrarian Innovation (PNIA).

The aim of the project is the development of a decision support system based on multispectral aerial imaging obtained through UAVs to help farmers in high-altitude environments in High Andean locations determine soil fertility, irrigation efficiency and estimate crop yield, among other benefits to reduce the impact of climate change.

The main tasks performed in this project were the following:

- Development of a low-cost image acquisition system consisting of an embedded board and two multispectral cameras.
- Design and fabrication of a prototype structure to attach image acquisition system to UAV systems.
- Acquisition system evaluation in flight missions carried out over high-altitude crops.
