The aim of the project is to develop an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) algorithm, in which the model is identified online by performing closed-loop linear model identification, for aerospace applications and develop diagnostics to determine the effect of hyperparameters on stabilization performance. In particular, Predictive Cost Adaptive Control (PCAC) is developed, implemented and evaluated as part of this project.

The main tasks performed in this project were the following:

- Evaluated absolute stability properties of PCAC applied to Lur'e systems (systems with nonlinear feedback).
- Applied PCAC to a Rijke-tube experiment to test stabilization performance over a range of operating conditions.
- Applied PCAC to nonlinear longitudinal aircraft dynamics in a simulation environment to test trajectory-following performance.
