The aim of the project is to develop an adaptive digital autopilot for UAVs to address unknown or unanticipated changes in flight conditions and prevent nominal flight performance degradation. For this purpose, the PX4 autopilot firmware is modified to enable the implementation of the adaptive autopilot solution. Tests were performed using multicopter, fixed-wing and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft.

The main tasks performed in this project were the following:

- Implemented an adaptive control algorithm in the PX4 autopilot firmware for simulation and physical testing.
- Designed and developed a wireless communication setup to allow the transmission of Motion Capture (MOCAP) measurements for state estimation.
