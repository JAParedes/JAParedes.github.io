The aim of the project is to apply adaptive control algorithms to minimize the oscillatory response of self-excited systems (SES), in particular, gas-turbine combustors, in which the interaction between combustion and acoustics causes thermoacoustic oscillations and may result in flameout, structural fatigue, thermal cycling, failure of combustor components, and poor combustion performance. For this purpose, retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) is applied to thermoacoustic systems under extremely limited modelling information and actuator limitations.

The main tasks performed in this project were the following:

- Developed a methodology to choose RCAC hyperparameters and applied RCAC to a Rijke-tube experiment to test stabilization performance over a range of operating conditions.
- Developed an extension of RCAC called quasi-static RCAC (QSRCAC) for online optimization applications, and applied it to a physical combustor to obtain operating conditions under which thermoacoustic oscillations are reduced while reaching a specified exit temperature corresponding to a desired flame length.
