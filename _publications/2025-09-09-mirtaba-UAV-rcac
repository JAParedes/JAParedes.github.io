This paper demonstrates the single-shot learning capabilities of retrospective cost optimization based data-driven control applied to learning multirotor controller gains for trajectory tracking. In particular, the proposed control approach is first used within a simple multirotor simulation environment to learn appropriate multirotor controller gains to follow a trajectory. Then, the gains resulting from a single simulation run are used in a more complex multirotor simulation environment based on Simulink for performance verification. Finally, the resulting gains are implemented in a physical quadrotor and the results for waypoint and trajectory tracking are reported in this paper. The proposed control approach is the continuous-time version of the widely used discrete-time retrospective control adaptive control algorithm, which is simpler to implement within continuous-time simulation environments and whose performance does not depend on appropriate sampling time choice.
