The traditional approach to synthesizing inner-loop/outer-loop controllers is to designate a control input, design an inner-loop controller to specify the actuator control input, close the inner loop by using a sensor to measure the designated control input, and then design the outer-loop controller to specify the requested value of the designated control input to be followed by the designated control input. This article illustrates how inner-loop/outer-loop control architectures are designed, and then investigates how the performance of the inner-loop controller impacts the performance of the overall control system. Three examples are presented to illustrate the design process for inner-loop/outer-loop control architectures.
