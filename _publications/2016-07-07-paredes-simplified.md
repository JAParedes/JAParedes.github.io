Quadcopters have recently become popular UAV systems due to the simplicity of their structure. PID controllers are simple and effective enough to stabilize and control this nonlinear dynamic system in hover operations; however, these are quite restrictive due to their linear nature. Therefore, in an attempt to extend the scope of use of these controllers and keep their intuitiveness, a Fuzzy-PD Controller structure is proposed with the purpose of combining the behaviors of several PD controller configurations. Moreover, a comparison will be established between the behavior and performance of differently configured PD controllers and a Fuzzy-PD Controller that incorporates their functionality depending on error input.
