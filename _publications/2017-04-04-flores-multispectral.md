Agriculture is one of the main sources of income for many families in the Peruvian Highlands. However, due to the rugged terrain of said region and the extension of croplands along mountainsides, it is difficult to supervise the entirety of the terrain and, subsequently, identify stressed and unhealthy crops to improve their production. In order to facilitate this task, a Fixed-Wing UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) System with Multispectral Cameras is proposed for identifying stressed crops over a determined zone. This system features an aircraft capable of 50 minutes of flight time at high-altitude with windy conditions. The payload is a multispectral camera system, and an embedded system coupled to the autopilot to trigger the camera system and store the resulting georeferenced images. Afterwards, the images will be processed with the purpose of calculating vegetative indexes and determining the status of the crops flown by the UAV.
