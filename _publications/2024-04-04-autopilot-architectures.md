In this paper, we develop, implement, and compare the performance of two distinct autopilot architectures for multicopter control. Specifically, we consider the cascaded P-PI controller architecture and the full-state feedback with integral action controller architecture. We numerically investigate the robustness of both of these architectures to multiplicative variations in controller gains. We then augment the fixed-gain control laws of both controller architectures with adaptive control laws updated by retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) and numerically investigate the performance improvements obtained by adaptive augmentation. Numerical simulation results are presented to compare the performance of all the autopilot architectures.
