A self-excited system is a nonlinear system with the property that a constant input yields a bounded, nonconvergent response. Nonlinear identification of self-excited systems is considered using a Lur’e model structure, where a linear model is connected in feedback with a nonlinear feedback function. To facilitate identification, the nonlinear feedback function is assumed to be continuous and piecewise affine (CPA). The present paper uses least-squares optimisation to estimate the coefficients of the linear dynamics and the slope vector of the CPA nonlinearity, as well as mixed-integer optimisation to estimate the order of the linear dynamics and the break points of the CPA function. The proposed identification technique requires only output data, and thus no measurement of the constant input is required. This technique is illustrated on a diverse collection of low-dimensional numerical examples as well as data from a gas-turbine combustor.
