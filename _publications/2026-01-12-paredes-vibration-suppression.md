This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.
