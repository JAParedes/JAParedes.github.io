excerpt: "This paper considers output-only identification for discrete-time hysteretic Lur'e (DTHL) systems, which are Lur'e systems with hysteretic feedback. The discrete-time model used to identify DTHL systems consists of asymptotically stable linear dynamics, a time delay, a washout filter, and a hysteretic nonlinear feedback mapping."

This paper considers output-only identification for discrete-time hysteretic Lur'e (DTHL) systems, which are Lur'e systems with hysteretic feedback. The discrete-time model used to identify DTHL systems consists of asymptotically stable linear dynamics, a time delay, a washout filter, and a hysteretic nonlinear feedback mapping. A nonlinear least-squares identification algorithm is developed for DTHL systems as an extension of an existing technique for identifying Lur'e systems with memoryless nonlinearity feedback. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of this technique for identifying DTHL systems.
