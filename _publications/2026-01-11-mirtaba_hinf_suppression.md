This paper presents an H2/H-infinity minimization-based output-feedback controller for active aeroelastic vibration suppression in a cantilevered beam. First, a nonlinear structural model incorporating moderate deflection and aerodynamic loading is derived and discretized using the finite element method (FEM). Then, a low-order linear model is identified from random gaussian input response data from the FEM model to synthesize an output-feedback controller using the H2/H-infinity framework. A frequency-weighted dynamic filter is introduced to emphasize disturbance frequencies of interest, enabling the controller to target dominant vibration modes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for vibration suppression and study its robustness to system parameter variations, including actuator placement.
