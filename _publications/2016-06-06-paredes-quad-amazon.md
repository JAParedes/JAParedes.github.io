Medicine transportation in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest is difficult due to environmental hazards and lack of proper land transportation roads, which leads to insufficient and improper health services in this area. In order to overcome the terrestrial impediments mentioned above and remedy this situation, a quadcopter UAV system is proposed to be used for aerial transportation of medicine. This paper will explain the mechanical, electrical and control design considerations taken into account for the implementation of the proposed system.
