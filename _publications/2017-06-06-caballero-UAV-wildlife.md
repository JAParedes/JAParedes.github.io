Wildlife inventories contribute to gauging the value of biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest. However, few studies have been made about this subject, mainly because of the lack of appropriate technology. In this paper, the design of hardware and software of a low-cost long-lasting time flight drone is proposed with the purpose of serving as a data mule to export data from an isolated wireless multimedia sensor network located in a remote nature reservation.
