The PID controllers featured in several commercial and industrial quadcopters present a simple framework which trivializes the control configuration process for these systems. However, since PID gains remain unchanged throughout the entire flight operation, only a single flight configuration is available for the quadcopter to move around. In order to give more flexibility to this control system, a Fuzzy-PD Controller structure based on the Sugeno fuzzy inference method is proposed. The suggested controller will be used to combine the behaviors of several PD controller configurations to control the states of a given quadcopter system and improve their individual performance.
